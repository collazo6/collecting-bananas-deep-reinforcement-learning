# Deep Reinforcement Learning: Training Agents on Specified Tasks
## Introduction
Deep Q Networks are among the most promising breakthroughs when it comes to the future of deep learning and realizing actual artificial intelligence.  While more primitive algorithms can be used for simple prediction tasks, Deep Q Networks enable scientists to train any agent on tasks through experience in predefined ecosystems.  This concept is very similar to the way humans are able to learn from their environment.  Through real experiences, humans are able to evaluate cues of encouragement or dissuasion from sensory information in order to build on their ideas on how to interact with the world around them.  Deliberate mathematical equations, theory and deep learning combine to enable this learning technique in artificial reality.

## Details
Utilizing a predefined environment, the above code initializes and trains an agent to perform a specific task through the use of positive and negative feedback.  Traversing a large square world, the agent performs actions based, in part, on optimizing its performance utilizing stored information on past experiences.
